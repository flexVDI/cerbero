    # Starting with v1.1, Opus has special ARM assembly optimizations when
    # built without floating point support. Since all our builds assume floating
    # point is available (NEON or VFP), we're not enabling that. However, the
    # option is there. Note that there is separate NEON/intrinsics support for
    # ARM and x86.
