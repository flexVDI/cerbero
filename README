Description
***********

cerbero is a multi-platform build system for Open Source projects that builds
and creates native packages for different platforms, architectures and distributions.

Projects are defined using recipes files (.recipe), which provides a description
of the project being built such as name, version, licenses, sources and the way
it's built. It also provide listing of files, which is later used for the packaging.

Packages are defined using packages files (.package), describing the package name,
version, license, maintainer and other fields used to create the packages. A
package wraps a list of recipes, from which the list of files belonging to the
package will be extracted.


********************
Minimum Requirements
********************

cerbero provides bootstrapping facilities for all platforms, but it still needs a
minimum base to bootstrap

Linux
-----
On Linux, you will only need a distribution with python 2.7.

OSX
---
On OSX you will need to have install the following software:
  * XCode

Windows
-------
The initial setup on Windows is a little bit longer, but only a few programs are required.
  * Python2.7: https://www.python.org/downloads/
     IMPORTANT : Chose the 2.7 version. The 3.x versions are *not* supported
  * CMake: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
  * Git: http://git-scm.com/download/win
     IMPORTANT: Select the install option "Checkout as-is, Commit as-is"
  * Msys/MinGW: http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download
     Install it with all the options enabled
  * WiX 3.5: http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102

The Direct Show plugins still needs to be built using Microsoft's compiler and their SDK,
due to the dependency on the Direct Show base classes.
You need to install the following software:
  * Microsoft SDK 7.1: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
  * Windows Driver Kit 7.1.0: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852365

cerbero must be run in the MingGW shell, which is accessible from the main menu or desktop 
(if it is not, go to Mingw Installation manager, select MSYS Base Development and install
msys-bash  lnk).

The last step is making python and git available from the shell, for which you will need
to create a .profile file:

If you use 64-bit Windows, please execute:

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/c/Python27:/c/Program Files (x86)/Git/bin:/c/MinGW/bin/"' > ~/.profile

If you use 32-bit Windows, please execute:

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/c/Python27:/c/Program Files/Git/bin:/c/MinGW/bin/"' > ~/.profile

Note that inside the shell, / is mapped to c:\Mingw\msys\1.0\

*****
Usage
*****

Despite the presence of setup.py this tool does not need installation. It is invoked via the
cerbero-uninstalled script, which should be invoked as ./cerbero-uninstalled, or you can add 
the cerbero directory in your path and invoke it as cerbero-uninstalled.

The examples below assume the tool is in your PATH; if not, just remember to use ./cerbero-uninstalled
instead of cerbero-uninstalled.

Bootstrap
---------
Before using cerbero for the first time, you will need to run the bootstrap command.
This command installs the missing parts of the build system using the packages manager
when available. Note that this will take a while (a couple hours or even more).
  $ cerbero-uninstalled bootstrap

Help
----
  $ cerbero-uninstalled --help

List available recipes
----------------------
  $ cerbero-uninstalled list

List available packages
-----------------------

Build a recipe
--------------
  $ cerbero-uninstalled build gtk+

Rebuild a single recipe
-----------------------
  $ cerbero-uninstalled buildone gtk+

Clean a recipe
--------------
